This is my first big project in React. I spent about 1 month doing it ( around 1.5 hours / day ). I know that there are lots of features that could be added to this, like a sidebar, infinite loading, search, liked posts, etc.

Techonologies I used : 
  - React
  - Tailwind
  - HighlightJS
  - Firebase authentication / storage / firestore
  - React Router
  - Material UI
  - Custom Hooks
  - Local Storage
 
Things to improve : 
  - Firebase
  - React Router
  - Better commits
  - Better folder structure
